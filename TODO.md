# To Do
- [X] Create iterator over params with nn.Module specific exclusion capability
- [X] In `unregister_params`, need to initialize to proper tensor size
- [X] Find global weight matrix dimensions
- [X] Establish initialization method
- [X] Test FFNN
- [X] Git branching
- [X] Recheck initialization method
- [X] Handle BatchNorm2d `fan_in`
- [X] Handle train() and eval() appropriately
- [X] argparse for jobs
- [X] Test ResNet
- [X] Docker containerization locally
- [X] Add logging for training times and accuracy
- [X] Add validation dataloader
- [ ] Compute weights 'on the fly' from variable pool
	- [X] forward() prehook and posthook
	- [ ] global method
	- [ ] create train/eval switch, possibly serialized flag
		- [ ] Obtain minimum compress
- [ ] Fine-tuning based on param size
	- [ ] Validation Set
	- [ ] Early stopping w/ checkpoints
	- [ ] Learning rate scheduler?
- [ ] Docker on EC2 (no GPU)
- [ ] Docker on EC2 (GPU)
- [ ] Find best `num_workers`
- [ ] Compare timings of training and evaluation vs compression
- [ ] S3 ?
- [ ] Setup Travis CI
- [X] Rename papers in ./references
- [ ] Analyze residual blocks
