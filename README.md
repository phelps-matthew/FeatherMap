## What is FeatherMap?
FeatherMap is a tool that compresses deep neural networks. Centered around computer vision models, it is an implementation of the Google Research paper [Structured Multi-Hashing for Model Compression (CVPR 2020)](references/Structured_Multi-Hashing_for_Model_Compression_CVPR_2020.pdf). Taking the form of a Python package, the tool takes a user-defined PyTorch model and compresses it to a desired factor, all without modification to the underlying architecture. Using it's simple API, FeatherMap can easily be applied across a broad array of models.
